# AI Engineering FAQ Chatbot - Technical Documentation

## Overview

This document provides technical details about the implementation of the AI Engineering FAQ Chatbot. The system uses natural language processing techniques to match user queries with the most relevant pre-defined FAQs about AI Engineering.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Flask
- **NLP Processing**: SpaCy
- **Vector Similarity**: scikit-learn's cosine_similarity
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)

## NLP Implementation Details

### Text Preprocessing

The system uses SpaCy for text preprocessing, which includes:

1. **Tokenization**: Breaking text into individual tokens (words, punctuation)
2. **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base form
3. **Vector Representation**: Converting text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning

SpaCy's pre-trained word vectors (`en_core_web_md` model) are used to represent the text in a high-dimensional space, which enables semantic matching beyond simple keyword matching.

### Question Matching Algorithm

The system matches user questions to FAQs using the following process:

1. **Preprocessing**: Both user questions and FAQ questions are processed using SpaCy
2. **Vector Comparison**: The system compares the vector representation of the user's question with all FAQ questions
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Using cosine similarity to measure the angle between vectors
4. **Threshold Filtering**: Only returning matches above a certain similarity threshold (currently set at 0.65)

### Why Cosine Similarity?

Cosine similarity was chosen because:
- It measures the angle between vectors, ignoring magnitude
- It works well for high-dimensional spaces like text embeddings
- It's efficient to compute
- It handles documents of different lengths well

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization

- FAQ questions are preprocessed at startup to avoid repeated processing
- Threshold value (0.65) was chosen based on experimentation to balance between false positives and false negatives

### Scalability

- The current implementation is suitable for hundreds of FAQs
- For larger datasets, consider:
  - Implementing a more efficient search algorithm (e.g., approximate nearest neighbors)
  - Using a database for FAQ storage
  - Implementing caching for frequent queries

## Future Improvements

1. **Intent Classification**: Adding an intent classification layer to better categorize user questions
2. **Entity Recognition**: Identifying specific entities in user questions for more precise matching
3. **Feedback Loop**: Implementing a feedback mechanism to improve matching over time
4. **Context Awareness**: Making the chatbot remember previous questions for context-aware responses
